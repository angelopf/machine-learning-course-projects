    "\n",
    "The management team of a large shopping mall would like to understand the types of people who are, or could be, visiting their mall. They have good reasons to believe that there are a few different market segments, and they are considering designing and positioning the shopping mall services better in order to attract mainly a few profitable market segments, or to differentiate their services (e.g. invitations to events, discounts, etc) across market segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to describe attitudes of people to shopping in a shopping mall using a small dataset (`Mall_Visits.csv`). To make these decisions, the management team run a market research survey of a few potential customers. In this case this was a small survey to only a few people, where each person answered six attitudinal questions and a question regarding how often they visit the mall, all on a scale 1-7, as well as one question regarding their household income:\n",

Ratings are real values ranging from -10.00 to +10.00 (the value \"99\" corresponds to \"null\" = \"not rated\"). The text of the jokes is given `jester_dataset_joke_text.zip`. The first column gives the number of jokes rated by that user. The next 100 columns give the ratings for jokes 01 - 100."
